# Linear-Regression
In this notebook, I use linear regression to model and estimate carbon dioxide emissions for a small range of cars according to their engine size. 
Accuracy and R-Squared metrics showed that first-order regression was not a good fit for this data and I used cross-validation to find a better higher-order fit. 
But it turned out that even higher-order regression models don't have the potential to represent the dynamics of this dataset.
